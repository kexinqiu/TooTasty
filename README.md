# TooTasty
TooTasty is a full-stack website application, which can search, rate and review restaurants.

TooTasty implements authentication and authorization. Usera can only review restaurants and view their profile after logging in. What's more, 
there are three diffrent roles: customer, owner, and admin, who have diffrent authority and view diffrente pages.

1. add env. into the root floder
2. install npm files
3. command "npm run dev" to run this whole application
4. command "npm run server" to run the backend
5. command "npm run client" to run the frontend
